Layers is a SwiftUI library for creating layered user interfaces. It's a simple and easy to use solution for creating smooth and performant animations between modal views.

Layers as it stands is not a perfect solution, but it's a start. Which is why I'm releasing it as an open source project, for the community to build upon.

If you'd like to contribute to Layers feel free to open an issue if you have any suggestions.
